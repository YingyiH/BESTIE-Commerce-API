This is an E-commerce application named BESTIE-commerce designed for online shopping enthusiasts around the world. This API manages key events enhancing the online selling and shopping experience for both sellers and customers.

The events are the product creating request and customer review posting request. They are received daily but the load increases at the weekends and holidays as customers spend more time in online shopping at the weekends and there are special offers on products on holidays to improve seller incomes and attract customers. We expect to have a peak load of 10,000 readings per second.
The readings are stored to allow the following:
- View trends of product popularity in different locations for sellers
- Monitoring and addressing customer feedback to enhance overall customer satisfaction
- Providing insights into website and application performance during peak usage times

The primary users of this system are sellers(i.e, creating new products) and customers (i.e, creating product comments).
